A game about a huntress.<br>

This project uses the MLX library of 42 schools.<br>

The aim of the game is to collect the arrows without touching the enemies and exit through the portal.

# Personal Notes

This was a solo project.

I used pre-made and free-to-use assets from the internet. First I have created 32x32 images with the MLX library. Than with the input I get from the map files, I drew the screen.
Than according to the user inputs, I swapped the images on the screen.

I used the MLX documentation mostly for this project.

In the end, I have created a mini-game that helped me understand how user inputs work in games. The project also sparked my interest in game development.
